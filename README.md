# SMART ADVERTISING USING AGE AND GENDER RECOGNITION

### This project is aimed at developing a System application to perform targeted advertising in real life rather than on the internet. Some features of this system will be Detecting the face , Approximately identifying the age and gender of a person and then displaying an ad based on that information. Targeted ads tends to produce more influence than conventional ads; therefore by using this System, advertisers can have an edge both online and offline.

<h2>About the Project :</h2>
<p> This project uses an Age and Gender Recognition model created by <a href="https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html">Tal Hassner and Gil Levi</a> which can differentitate a person as 'MALE' and 'FEMALE' with 8 Age Ranges : (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100).By using this model the approximate age range and gender can be obtained, although the accuracy of the model is affected by factors such as lighting,facial Coverings,makeup,quick movements etc.<p>
